## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Prompts  

### **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic was why companies are investing so much of their efforts into quantization. Because of privacy reasons, these neural network models need to run on mobile devices. It is harder to get good performace on these devices using the original neural network so we need to find methods to quantize. 

### **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to investigate mixed-precision quantization for LLMs to see if performance can improve.

### **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change would be to only use a subset of the data for quantization so that it matches the data that the model was trained on so computational load can decrease.

### **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would also be interesting in pruning, where less important weights/neurons would be removed to reduce its size.
